Summoner: The Bescarfed
======================
The epic tale of a youth who must take up the Scarf of Strategically-Limited Power to protect his... village, or something, from the oncoming hordes of -- darkness? demons? interloping militant vegans? -- using only the power of his scarf. Oh, and also the power of a bunch of demons or djinn or monsters which he summons through magicks ancient, arcane, and spelled with a "k." (Said magicks are also likely destroying his soul, or whatever. So there's a *price to payyy* oooo.)

======================
Made with Flixel. This is my first attempt at putting together a game of my own design.

The repo is public because I doubt if anything I'm doing here is going to be top-notch at any rate -- that is: I wouldn't recommend reading my code if you're looking for best practices.

I'd rather if you didn't use my sprites, but if you do just throw some credit-love my way.
